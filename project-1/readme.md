### Let's Start!

First of all, direct your attention to this amazing screenshot taken on my lovely computer!

Now that you've seen my super awesome screenshot, lets move onto other matters!

### Issues

So now let's talk about some of the issues I've been having with GitHub

1. I felt pretty ashamed that it was not easy for me, as I come from a technology background.
2. It was difficult trying to figure out what assignment was actually due at the time because it was on both Moodle **AND** GitHub.
3. I didn't even realize that there were additional topics on the website, besides the introduction, for a few days. (website is located [here](https://media-ed-online.github.io/intro-web-dev))

### Good Things

Since it seems like you are still here, let me now talk about the good things!

- Now that I have successfully figured out how things work, they work great!
- Reaching out to the instructor was easy to do, and produced results **FAST**.
- I learned that I was *NOT* alone in my beginning frustrations.
- I think this class is going to be fun!
- I realized that markdown is similar to the formatting settings on [Reddit's](http://www.reddit.com) website.

### Summary

All in all, now that I have things sorta-kinda figured out, I feel like I am going to thoroughly enjoy this class. I have always had an interest in coding and programming, and since I am still an *undeclared* student, this class is making me consider it as a career choice.

### BONUS FEATURE:

I remember as a kid I had a really cool "computer" that I got as a gift. It was a learning-type system and it taught you how to code in **BASIC**.

Here is a simple line that is often used in computer programming in some form:

```
10 Print "Hello World"
```
