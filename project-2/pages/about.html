        <h2><u>About the Author</u>:</h2>
        <p>Michael Friedman is a 28 year old computer technician who is returning to school to move up in ranks in the information technology field. He has a very deep love for people, nature, and garlic bread.</p>
        <p>In the next 5 years, Michael hopes to open and run a garlic bread themed tech support company. Maybe he'll bake fresh garlic bread and give it away with repairs! Maybe he'll have a bakery/tech repair store! One thing is for certain though, he loves his garlic bread.</p>
