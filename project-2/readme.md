### Let's Start!
I am excited to learn more about coding, looks like we are diving right in to more advanced stuff!

So far I have learned about how websites automatically attempt to call an ```index.html``` file when you access the web address.

I really enjoyed the [instructables website](http://www.instructables.com/). It has some really cool projects that I would love to do, *if I ever had any free time...* **LOL**
