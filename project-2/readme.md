### Let's Start!
I am excited to learn more about coding, looks like we are diving right in to more advanced stuff!

So far I have learned about how websites automatically attempt to call an ```index.html``` file when you access the web address.

I really enjoyed the [instructables website](http://www.instructables.com/). It has some really cool projects that I would love to do, *if I ever had any free time...* **LOL**

Comments are very interesting. I just learned how to make comments in html, and proper formatting of them.

I've played around with meta code headings including the title of the page, author, character set, and more!

Learning about *semantic markup* is great! It will allow me to make my websites accessible to people who need assistance, and have cool features like abreviations and strikethrough on text!

So far I've started my website as a recipe for **amazing** garlic bread!

I played around with the ```<style>``` tag and made my background light green! I also added a cool CSS feature to increase the text size of my list items! My site looks great now!

I hope people enjoy my recipe!

I just wanted to note that I hope to learn some better ways to make text spacing on these pages easier to do. I spent a lot of time modifying margins on this website.
