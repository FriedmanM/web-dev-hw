        <td class="abouttext"><strong>Hunter Stockton Thompson</strong> (July 18, 1937 â€“ February 20, 2005)
                             was an American journalist and author, and the founder of the gonzo
                             journalism movement. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a middle-class
                             family, Thompson had a turbulent youth after the death of his father
                             left the family in poverty. He was unable to formally finish high
                             school as he was incarcerated for 60 days after abetting a robbery.
                             He subsequently joined the United States Air Force before moving
                             into journalism. He traveled frequently, including stints in California,
                             Puerto Rico, and Brazil, before settling in Aspen, Colorado, in the
                             early 1960s.

        <td class="abouttext">Thompson became internationally known with the publication of <em>Hell's
                              Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs</em>
                              (1967). For his research on the book he had spent a year living and
                              riding with the Angels, experiencing their lives and hearing their
                              stories first-hand. Previously a relatively conventional journalist,
                              with the publication in 1970 of <em>The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and
                              Depraved</em> he became a counter cultural figure, with his own brand of
                              New Journalism which he termed "Gonzo", an experimental style of
                              journalism where reporters involve themselves in the action to such
                              a degree that they become central figures of their stories. The work
                              he remains best known for, <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage 
                              Journey to the Heart of the American Dream</em> (1971), constitutes a
                              rumination on the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement. It
                              was first serialized in <em>Rolling Stone</em>, a magazine with which Thompson
                              would be long associated, and was released as a film starring Johnny
                              Depp and Benicio del Toro and directed by Terry Gilliam in 1998.
