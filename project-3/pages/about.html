                             was an American journalist and author, and the founder of the gonzo

                             family, Thompson had a turbulent youth after the death of his father
                             left the family in poverty. He was unable to formally finish high
                             school as he was incarcerated for 60 days after abetting a robbery.
                             He subsequently joined the United States Air Force before moving
                             into journalism. He traveled frequently, including stints in California,
                             Puerto Rico, and Brazil, before settling in Aspen, Colorado, in the
                             early 1960s.
