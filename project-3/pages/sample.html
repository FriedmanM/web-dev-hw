          W</span>e were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the
                           desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember
                           saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded;
                           maybe you should drive. ..." And suddenly there was
                           a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full
                           of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and
                           screeching and diving around the car, which was going
                           about 100 miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.
                           And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these
                           goddamn animals?"</p>

                    <p>Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his
                      shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate
                      the tanning process. "What the hell are you yelling about?"
                      he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and
                      covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind," I
                      said. "It's your turn to drive." I hit the brakes and aimed
                      the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway.
                      No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard
                      will see them soon enough.</p>

                  <p>It was almost noon, and we still had more than 100 miles to go.
                    They would be tough miles. Very soon, I knew, we would both be
                    completely twisted. But there was no going back, and no time to
                    rest. We would have to ride it out. Press registration for the fabulous
                    Mint 400 was already underway, and we had to get there by four to
                    claim our soundproof suite. A fashionable sporting magazine in New
                    York had taken care of the reservations, along with this huge red
                    Chevy convertible we'd just rented off a lot on the Sunset Strip ...
                    and I was, after all, a professional journalist; so I had an obligation
                    to cover the story, for good or ill.</p>

                    which was already spent on extremely dangerous drugs. The trunk
                    of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had
                    two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of
                    high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine,
                    and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers,
                    laughers ... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case
                    of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.</p>
