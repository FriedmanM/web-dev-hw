          W</span>e were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the
                           desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember
                           saying something like "<i><quote>I feel a bit lightheaded;
                           maybe you should drive. ...</quote></i>" And suddenly there was
                           a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full
                           of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and
                           screeching and diving around the car, which was going
                           about 100 miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.
                           And a voice was screaming: "<i><quote>Holy Jesus! What are these
                           goddamn animals?</quote></i>"</p>

                      shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate
                      the tanning process. "<i><quote>What the hell are you yelling about?</quote></i>"
                      he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and
                      covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "<i><quote>Never mind,</quote></i>" I
                      said. "<i><quote>It's your turn to drive.</quote></i>" I hit the brakes and aimed
                      the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway.

                    They would be tough miles. <span class="bolder">Very soon, I knew, we would both be

                    rest. We would have to ride it out. Press registration for the fabulous
                    Mint 400 was already underway, and we had to get there by four to
                    claim our soundproof suite. A fashionable sporting magazine in New
                    York had taken care of the reservations, along with this huge red
                    Chevy convertible we'd just rented off a lot on the Sunset Strip ...
                    and I was, after all, a professional journalist; so I had an obligation

                   into that rotten stuff pretty soon. Probably at the next gas station.
                   We had sampled almost everything else, and now – yes, it was time for a
                   long snort of ether. And then do the next 100 miles in a horrible,
                   slobbering sort of spastic stupor. The only way to keep alert on ether
                   is to do up a lot of amyls – not all at once, but steadily, just enough
                   to maintain the focus at <span class="bolder">90 miles an hour through Barstow</span>.
