### Let's Start!

## CSS

I really **Love** being able to make a whole style sheet seperate from the HTML document to put everything on regarding color and other styles. This will make html pages look a lot easier to read and cleaner code. **EXCITING!**

The many selector options are a little overwhelming. I don't think I'll be able to memorize all of them, but I'll certainly know a few by name. This is going to make our pages look a lot better with much less time spent individually styling elements.

## Project 3:

I am unsure what I want to do this project on yet. Still trying to decide and I don't have much time left.
