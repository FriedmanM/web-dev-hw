                        e were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the
                               desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember
                               saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded;
                               maybe you should drive. ..." And suddenly there was
                               a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full
                               of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and
                               screeching and diving around the car, which was going
                               about 100 miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.
                               And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these
                               goddamn animals?"</p>

                        <p>Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his
                          shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate
                          the tanning process. "What the hell are you yelling about?"
                          he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and
                          covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind," I
                          said. "It's your turn to drive." I hit the brakes and aimed
                          the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway.
                          No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard
                          will see them soon enough.</p>

                      <p>It was almost noon, and we still had more than 100 miles to go.
                        They would be tough miles. Very soon, I knew, we would both be
                        completely twisted. But there was no going back, and no time to
                        rest. We would have to ride it out. Press registration for the fabulous
                        Mint 400 was already underway, and we had to get there by four to
                        claim our soundproof suite. A fashionable sporting magazine in New
                        York had taken care of the reservations, along with this huge red
                        Chevy convertible we'd just rented off a lot on the Sunset Strip ...
                        and I was, after all, a professional journalist; so I had an obligation
                        to cover the story, for good or ill.</p>
