### Let's Start!

I am starting my assignment working through responsive design. I am excited to make a website that works on mobile, tablet, and laptop/desktop computers.

I had a hard time starting the assignment to be honest. I've decided to go with a site that is 3 blocks and an image at the top. I will upload sketches soon, but I already kinda started the site before (oops). I am having the end of the semester crash right now and its been really hard to manage work, school, and relationships, and I'm trying not to die.
