### Let's Start!

I am starting my assignment working through responsive design. I am excited to make a website that works on mobile, tablet, and laptop/desktop computers.

---

I had a hard time starting the assignment to be honest. I've decided to go with a site that is 3 blocks and an image at the top. I will upload sketches soon, but I already kinda started the site before (oops). I am having the end of the semester crash right now and its been really hard to manage work, school, and relationships, and I'm trying not to die.

### Information:

This page will aim to deliver basic information about responsive web design, some of the tools used, and why it is important.

The first thing on the page that will draw the eye is a cool picture I'm trying to locate, followed by the information about RWD.

The primary content of the page is the description of responsive web design.
The secondary content of the page is an explaination of why rwd is important.

### Things Included:

I am going to include 2 pictures (one catchy eye bling, and another that pertains to RWD).
I really like the fonts I used on project 3 and may use them again.
As far as color goes, I was thinking about doing different shades of blue for the blocks, maybe make the header green, and the entire page background for desktop a navy blue.
