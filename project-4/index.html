              <h2>What is RWD?</h2>
              <p><abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> is a Web design approach aimed at crafting
                sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum
                of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to
                desktop computer monitors).
              </p>
              <p>Basically, if you want a site to be viewable on a phone, computer, tablet, smart tv, or
                 other type of website viewing device, you would want to use responsive web design so that the
                 layout of the site can span different sized devices.
              </p>
              <p>People usually start with a mobile site, and work their way to a larger format. A site should be
                 easily viewable without having to zoom in, have too many scroll bars, and pictures should resize
                 for the type of screen.
              </p>
              <p>Responsive web design is very important in web development. It can reduce the overall cost of
                 designing websites because you are creating one site that works on multiple devices. Many people
                 agree that having a clean looking website on their mobile devices is very important to them.

              <h2>Tools and Terms:</h2>
              <p>For starters, it is always a great idea to plan or sketch out your website design. Starting with the
                 smallest screen, and working your way up. Some people like to hand draw their designs, some people use
                 programs like photoshop to plan out the details. These sketches are called <i>wireframes</i>
              </p>
              <p><i>Flexframes</i> are boxes that are ordered in appearence on the website, and can move when the size of
                 the screen is adjusted, or when viewed on different sized screens.
